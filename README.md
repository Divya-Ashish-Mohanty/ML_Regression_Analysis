# ML_Regression_Analysis
---
## Description
This repository contains machine learning projects focused on building linear regression models to predict sales,house pricings and PCI (Per-Capita Income) of a nation. Using Python, these projects analyze datasets, apply feature engineering, and create predictive models using linear regression techniques. The main datasets used is related to Walmart_Sales, California_House_Pricing and Canada_PCI and the notebooks demonstrate end-to-end workflows, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

### Key Features:
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights from the Walmart sales dataset.
- **Linear Regression Modeling:** Application of linear regression techniques to predict sales based on various features.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Includes well-documented notebooks that walk through the process step-by-step.
- **Kaggle:** Includes well-detailed datasets that helped me feed the model with required data.
- 
### Requirements:
To run the notebooks, install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divya_ashish_mohanty/ML_Regression_Analysis.git
   cd ML_Regression_Analysis
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks to see the various linear regression analysis in action.

3. Follow the steps in the notebooks to preprocess data, train the linear regression model, and evaluate its performance.

### Contributing
